# Conductor Instrument

**Conductor Instrument** is the Robotic Programming Term Project that using `Arduino Uno` and `MPR121` sensor.
<br>
` MPR121` is electrostatic touch sensor.
<br>
<br>
## About project
I tried to use the MP3 module for sound output, but I had the following difficulties.
* Transportability problem.
* Low quality of sound.
* Difficulty of multiple contacts.

so, I use `Serial Communication` using `MIDI-Serial bridge`.
